    "# Can a Machine Beat the Best Tennis Player in the World?#\n",
    "Since I'm both a big tennis fan and data nerd, I've long wanted to know how a machine learning algorithm would cope against the best fantasy tennis players in the world. Could it even beat them? To answer this question I will build a machine learning model and see if it will manage to predict the outcome of tennis matches better than the best fantasy tennis player in the world. More specifically I will set up a challenge that will consist of predicting which player will be the winner of a tennis match:\n",
    "- I will use 1758 matches from all 66 ATP singles tournaments during 2018, excluding the ATP tour final. The year 2018 was chosen since it was the last complete season available at the time. More details about how the match selection was done can be found this blog post: https://medium.com/@marcusnilsson78/can-a-machine-beat-the-best-tennis-player-in-the-world-79112b47f547\n",
    "- Only data available before a tournament started can be used to predict the match.\n",
    "- The contestants in the challenge will be; a benchmark prediction, the best fantasy tennis player and the machine learning model which all will predict the outcome of the same matches.\n",
    "- Accuracy will be used to measure how good the contestants predictions were. That means that the contestant that managed to correctly predict the most number of matches will win. Accuracy is calculated by taking number of correct predictions divided by all predictions. Eg. if 50 out of 100 matches are predict correctly, the accuracy will be 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm using the fantasy tennis site www.tennisdrawchallenge.com to gather data about the best fantasy tennis player. When I build the machine learning model I use the files provided by Jeff Sackmann found here https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp. Jeff has shared free high quality tennis data for years so a big thank you to him. With the data I do the following:\n",
    "- All ATP including qualification plus challenger matches for year 2000-2018 is used as input for the model. The ATP tour final and RR tournaments are filtered out. I make sure that only data that was available before the match started is used.\n",
    "- Only ATP matches for years 2008-2017 is used to train and test the model.\n",
    "- The model will then predict the same 2018 matches as the benchmark prediction and the best fantasy tennis player.\n",

    "    - **hth**: Take into account all historic meetings\n",
    "    - **hth_5**: Last 5 meetings\n",
    "- **winrate**: How many percent of all matches a player has won is a good indicator of how good he is. Will try some variations:\n",
    "    - **winrate**: All history\n",
